// userController.js
// meant to handle user verification instructions
// i.e:
// - sets isLoggedIn to true,
// - sends it to cookies for it to be checked
// - users auth.js to do checking
// - compares it in auth.js and receives a bool flag
// - dictates what needs to be done based on response from auth.js and frontend
