FastAPI is a python web-framework
Keeps everything simple and easy to scale
Fast - Performance, faster than other options, comes with data validation and documentation
Fast - It is very easy to develop with, prevents reinventing the wheel. Easy to deploy and has good community

Key notes:
allows you to develop your own APIs with less bugs due to data validation
easy to learn and develop as its built with consideration to developers
robust
it has development standards, matches json schema and means api standards

application architechture

Web Page <--> Rest API for data transfer <--> Server, FastAPI
handles logic and renders webpage

example use of FastAPI:
netflix
uber
microsoft

libraries
pip install bcrypt==4.0.1, cryptography, fastapi, psycopg2-binary, PyMySQL, python-jose, python-multipart, SQLAlchemy, uvicorn, passlib

fast api has has their own equilavent of crud operations

CRUD              HTTP Request Methods
Create            POST
Read              GET
Update            PUT
Delete            DELETE

async is not needed for FastAPI, as FastAPI automatically treats it as an async function regardless but it is beneficial to be explicit

uvicorn being used is the web server that is used to start the FastAPI application

swagger is a interactive ui that helps display fast api requests in a more user friendly manner
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

uvicorn FastAPI.udemy_course.own_code.books:app --reload
this runs the FastAPI app, the --reload automatically reloads the site everytime a save is changed, and with VSCode it is automatically saved so it updates as you tab out to view the site



path paameters are request aparamets that are attached to the url
defined as a way to find information, based on the url

you can make dynammic paths

order matters with path params
have static/ smaller and faster apis first, so they load in order

for urls, if they have " " <space>, substitute it with "%20"

you can go to:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/books/title%20one
directly, but swagger makes it easier to view and understand


query parameters are request parameters that have been attatched after a "?"
query params have a name=value pairs

http://127.0.0.1:8000/books/?category=science
it acts as a filter almost

query parameters can be used with path parameters, especially when trying to figure out additional information



POST requests are used to create data. youre posting data to the system
POST can have additional info that GET does not have within
POST can take in an aidditional parameter body that GET cannot

what does = mean when passing parameters into a function?
it will assign a defualt value to the parameter being passed through, i.e:

async def create_book(new_book=Body()):
    ...
    ...
    ...
    return ...

if there isnt new_book being passed into the function it will be taken as Body() automatically, as a defualt value


PUT requests are CRUD updates
can have additional information like a POST that GET may not have

DELETE method, is the CRUD DELETE
used to delete data
if you have request, you can attatch path param, i.e. book param and delete that entry


what is a path parameter:
variables that are a part of the API's url

query parameters are used to sort and filter through data that is not marked by a path parameter


for path parameters, /books/author/{author} means we are passing a dynamic author paramter, which is contained within author, which is contained within books
path is for specific parameter/value you are after, i.e. id or title of a game


query parameters are used for when you know one aspect of the search you want to do, i.e. if you want to search for the authors within the science category of books
query params are used to provide additional context to a serach
query is for broader searches, such as genres, ratings, 'queries' with multiple outputs


Pydantic v1 versus Pydantic v2:

.dict() [function] .model_dump()
schema_extra [function in Config class] json_schema_extra
Optional variables require to be assinged None, i.e.        id = optional[int] = None


What is Pydantics?

Python lib that is used for data modelling, data parsing and efficient error handling
Used commonly as a tool for data validation and handling for FastAPI application
