Initialization and Setup
Power On Initialization: Include steps for what happens when the ESP32 powers on, such as initializing GPIO pins and setting up the initial state of the LED strip.
Network Connection: Include steps for connecting to the local network and what happens if the connection fails.
Web UI
Interface Design: Expand on what the Web UI will look like and how it will be intuitive for users to select colors, brightness, and effects.
Input Validation: Include processes to validate user input to prevent errors when sending the payload.
Functionality and Control
Mode Selection: Elaborate on how users will select different modes or presets, if available.
Real-time Feedback: Consider adding a mechanism for the web UI to receive real-time feedback from the ESP32 about the current state of the LED strip.
Synchronization: Detail how the ESP32 will stay in sync with the web UI, especially if multiple users can control it at once.
Data Handling
Payload Processing: Include steps for how the ESP32 will parse and act on the payload from the web server.
Memory Management: Since EEPROM has limited write cycles, detail how you will manage EEPROM writes to avoid excessive write operations.
Safety and Error Handling
Error Responses: Outline how the system will handle errors, such as incorrect payloads or hardware malfunctions.
Recovery Mechanisms: Add steps for how the system can recover from errors or unexpected resets.
Testing and Maintenance
Testing Procedures: Describe how you will test each component of the system to ensure it works correctly.
Firmware Updates: Plan for how you will update the program stored in EEPROM, if necessary.
Scalability and Extensions
Future Features: Make notes on potential future features or extensions, such as adding more LED strips or integrating with smart home systems.
Resource Management: Ensure that there's a plan for optimizing memory and processing power, as these are limited on the ESP32.
Documentation
Comments and Documentation: Ensure that the code and hardware setup are well-documented for future reference or for other developers to understand and contribute.
This feedback should give you a solid foundation to refine your project plan. Remember that the plan should be adaptable as new insights or requirements come up during development.
